                        We focus on making meals with thebest and freshest faq, like humanely-raised beef that is ground fresh each day, organic chicken, and Rockey Family Dairy’s organic cream for our ice cream cones, sundaes and shakes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ourcommitment to freshnessand quality means higher prices than you’d find at traditional fast-food burger chains. It also means food that tastes way better — because, well, it is.

                    <p>
                        We source our humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed beef from local, family-owned ranches. We use an 85% to 15% protein to fat blend, a mixture of the lean protein and the marbling found on in a cut of steak for our ground beef. The mixture is ground daily, and thus, our burgers taste so amazing.
